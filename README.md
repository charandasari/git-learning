India, under its Digital India Initiative, has issued an innovation challenge to develop video conferencing solutions in high and low network scenarios. These will be critical to propel India’s economy forward. India’s flexi-work blueprint must include flexi-hours—non-rigid timings, predictability and choice over scheduling of overtimes, breaks, and shifts—and flexi-place, which allows for work from home or satellite locations. This will allow employers to attract and retain the best global talent, reduce office rental space, while also boosting worker productivity, lowering commuting and living costs, and improving work-life balance.

Flexi-hours can be piloted across sectors; flexi-place is more suited to the knowledge service sector, where technology may be integrated into daily functioning. Economic productivity will enhance as the focus shifts from inputs (attendance clocked) to outcomes (tasks delivered); a recent Regus report estimated that by 2030, India could see an economic boost of as much as $376 billion annually from flexible working.

With a burgeoning knowledge sector and the second largest online market, India is ushering in the fourth industrial revolution. Leveraging the full potential of our demographic dividend will only be possible if flexi-work is established as a people-driven work movement—the real Jan Andolan, where people dictate how the workday unfolds. The time is right for a Gen-Flex, where people work smarter, harder, and happier, propelling India towards an accelerated growth trajectory.
